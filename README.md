# Technical Council Wesbite 2022 | IIT Gandhinagar

TLDR of the official documentation.

Everything starts in pages/_app.js and pages/index.js

Each route ["/Home", "/Internships", etc] has a different folder under pages. Under each folder we have the main page as index.js.

All reusable components are stored under src/Common folder.

All constants such as primary and secondary color, route names are stored under src/Constants.

The styles here are unique. The globals.css file contains css that are followed throughout the website.
Page specific styles are written as Page.module.css (eg. Home.module.css). The styles of common components go under styles/Common/Components.module.css


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
